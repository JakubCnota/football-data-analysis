**Football Data Analysis Project**

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the complete process of football data analysis, from raw CSV files to interactive dashboards using Excel, SQL Server and Power BI. Each step is documented with clear explanations and visualizations to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

**Data Size and Processing Approach**
The dataset includes a combination of large files that exceed Excelâ€™s capacity and smaller files that comfortably fit within Excel and Power Query limits.

Large datasets are processed directly in SQL Server to leverage its high performance, scalability, and robust data integrity features. SQL Server handles complex transformations, data validation, and aggregation efficiently, making it ideal for heavy data processing tasks.

Smaller datasets (approximately 1000 records) are processed in Power Query. Power Query offers a flexible, user-friendly environment for data cleaning, filling missing values, renaming columns, and performing lightweight transformations without requiring advanced SQL skills or database access.

This hybrid approach optimizes the workflow by balancing performance and ease of use, ensuring that each data subset is handled in the most appropriate environment.
